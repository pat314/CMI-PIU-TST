In today’s world, the widespread use of the Internet among children and adolescents has raised concerns about its potential negative impacts. Problematic internet use (PIU) has been increasingly associated with adverse mental health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and social withdrawal. As young individuals rely more heavily on digital technologies, addressing PIU has become a priority for researchers and practitioners seeking to mitigate its effects and promote healthier lifestyles.

Despite its importance, identifying and measuring PIU in children and adolescents remains a significant challenge. Traditional approaches often depend on complex clinical assessments that require specialized expertise, making them inaccessible to many families. Cultural and linguistic barriers further exacerbate this issue, limiting the adoption of standardized assessment tools. Consequently, PIU is often inferred through its correlation with observable symptoms, such as declines in mental health or academic performance, rather than being directly measured.

In contrast, physical and fitness indicators offer a promising alternative due to their accessibility and ease of measurement. Studies have highlighted the relationship between excessive technology use and changes in physical habits, such as decreased physical activity, irregular dietary patterns, and poor posture. Leveraging these easily obtainable metrics as proxies for PIU could provide an efficient and scalable solution, particularly in resource-constrained settings lacking clinical expertise.

The competition is held for the purpose harnessing this potential by developing predictive models that analyze physical activity and fitness data to detect early signs of problematic internet use. By enabling timely interventions, these models can support the adoption of healthier digital habits and contribute to the broader well-being of children and adolescents.

Since the beginning of this competition on November 24, 2024, our team has made significant progress in exploring predictive solutions. Over the span of nearly one month, we submitted a total of 66 solutions to the competition, from which 13 distinct versions were selected for analysis in this paper. Of these, two submissions achieved private scores of 0.453 and 0.454 on Kaggle’s leaderboard, helping our team up to **rank 108th of 3628 teams** and get the **place Silver Medalist** . Furthermore, **our best-performing version attained a private score of** **0.473**, marking a considerable improvement and showcasing the effectiveness of our iterative approach to refining models.
